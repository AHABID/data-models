## Roadmap 

The Roadmap of the Smart Data Models Initiative is the following: 

* Adopt additional Data Models from the 
[FIWARE Data Models Project](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-models). 
This will depend on the needs and priorities of cities (demand-side). 

* Adopt additional Data Models from the 
[SynchroniCity Data Models Project](https://gitlab.com/synchronicity-iot/synchronicity-data-models)

* Add additional Data Models pero other methods defined by the FIWARE Foundation and TMForum. 

* Validate NGSI-LD content. 
The validation tool (see [tools repository](https://github.com/smart-data-models/tools)) has to be tweaked to perform NGSI-LD validation of examples
, once Orion-LD is in a more mature state. 

* Generate the JSON-LD @context in a neutral namespace, different than FIWARE's. 
Using [https://github.com/FIWARE/data-models/blob/master/tools/ldcontext_generator.py](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-models/blob/master/tools/ldcontext_generator.py)

* Adopt automatic documentation generation to be developed by FIWARE Data Models. 
See [https://github.com/FIWARE/data-models/issues/550](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-models/issues/550)

* Generate Schema definitions in JSON JSON-LD as suggested by 
[https://github.com/FIWARE/data-models/issues/551](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-models/issues/551)
