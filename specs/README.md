In this directory are located the repositories for the *domains*. 

*Domains* are economic / industrial sectors. *Domains* contain *topics*. 

*Topics* are small sectors that can belong to different domains. Topics are independent repositories that can be led by
different organisations.

From the point of view of git *Topics* are submodules of the *Domains* and therefore periodically there will be automatic updates unless relevant changes happen in a *topic*.

There is also a special *domain* named *CrossSector* for those *Topics* that cannot be properly assigned to other *Domain*.
